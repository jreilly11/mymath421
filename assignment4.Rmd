title: "Assignment 4 - Data Wrangging with `dplyr`"
---

***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](assignment4.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- Notice that if there is `eval=FALSE` in the first line of the code chunk, the chunk will not be execute.

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas under Assignment 4. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

-------

#### 1. Install `tidyverse` package

An R package can be installed by `install.packages` function. Install `tidyverse` if you have not done so. 

```{r}
# install.packages('tidyverse')
```

-------

#### 2. Read the data using `read_csv`

Use `read_csv` function to import the US Covid 19 data at [link](https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv).  Don't forget to import `tidyverse` (library(tidyverse)) so that you can use read_csv. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
covid_df <- read_csv("all-states-history.csv")
```

-------

#### 3.  Fix the date and ceate some new variables

`lubridate` is a package of the `tidyverse` packages.  We will make uses of `lubridate` in this question.

- Use the below codes to create `month`, `weekday` and `monthday` variables

```{r}
library(lubridate)
covid_df$month = month(covid_df$date)

# day of the week
covid_df$weekday = wday(covid_df$date)

# day of the month
covid_df$monthday <- mday(covid_df$date)
```

-------

#### 4. Create new variables with `case_when`. 

The function `case_when` is a good option to create a new variable from existing variable.  For example, this below codes create a new variable, `daily_death`, from `deathIncrease` variable.  `deathIncrease` is the number of daily new death by Covid19.  The new variable `daily_death` takes three values:  low (if `deathIncrease` less than 3), medium (`deathIncrease` from 3 to 14), and high (`deathIncrease` more than 14).  Please notice that this can also be done in a different way as shown in Assignment 3. 

```{r}
covid_df$daily_death <- case_when(
  covid_df$deathIncrease <3 ~ 'low',
  covid_df$deathIncrease <=14 ~ 'medium',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)
```

- Create variable `month2` that takes three values: early_month (day of the month from 1-10), mid_month (day of the month from 11-20), and end_month (day of the month > 20).
```{r}
covid_df$month2 <- case_when(
  covid_df$monthday <= 10 ~ 'early_month',
  covid_df$monthday <= 20 ~ 'mid_month',
  TRUE ~ 'end_month')
```

- Create variable `weekend` that takes two values:  1 if it's Saturday or Sunday or 0 otherwise. 
```{r}
covid_df$weekend <- case_when(
  covid_df$weekday == 6 ~ 'Saturday',
  covid_df$weekday == 7 ~ 'Sunday',
  TRUE ~ '0')
```

-------

#### 5. Select function

Use the select function to deselect the column `totalTestsViral` from the data.
```{r}
covid_df %>% select(-totalTestsViral)
```

-------

#### 6. Pipe Operator ( %>% )

Pipe operator offers another way to write R codes. Many times, it makes the codes more readable.  Pipe works very well with all the `tidyverse` packages. Refer to [these slides](../slides/4_dplyr.html#15) (slide 15, 16, 17 and 18) to rewrite the below codes using pipe operator

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)

# square root of x
sqrt(x)
x %>% sqrt

sum(sqrt(x))
x %>% sqrt %>% sum

log(sum(sqrt(x)))
x %>% sqrt %>% sum %>% log

# log base 2 of 16
log(16, 2)
16 %>% log(2)

```

-------

#### 7. Combo 1: group_by + summarise

This combo is used when you want to apply a function/calculation to different groups of the data. For example, to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `dataQualityGrade`, we use:

```{r}
covid_df %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month`
```{r}
covid_df %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month2`
```{r}
covid_df %>%
  group_by(month2) %>%
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `weekend`
```{r}
covid_df %>%
  group_by(weekend) %>%
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```


-------

#### 8. Combo 2: filter + group_by + summarise

An example: to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) in January and February separately, we use:

```{r}
covid_df %>% 
  filter(month==1|month==2) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(positve_increase = mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) on the weekend by `month` in October and November 2020. 
```{r}
# Creating year column
library(lubridate)
covid_df$year<- year(covid_df$date)
```

```{r}
covid_df %>%
  filter(weekday== 6 | weekday== 7, month == 10 | month == 11, year==2020) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(positiveIncrease = median(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the average number of death at different periods of a month (`month2` variable) in Fall 2020
```{r}
covid_df %>%
  filter(month== 9 | month == 10 | month == 11, year==2020) %>%
  group_by(month2) %>%
  summarise(deaths = mean(death))
```

- Compare the average number of hospitalizations between weekdays and weekends in Summer 2020
```{r}
covid_df %>%
  filter(month==6 | month == 7 | month == 8, year==2020) %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(hospitalizations = mean(hospitalized, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Redo Questions 14 and 15 in [Assignment 3](assignment3.html) using the combos.  Notice:  you also need to use the data used in Assignment 3.  
```{r}
# Recreating df from Assignment 3
data <- read.csv("us-states.csv")
names(data) <- toupper(names(data))

# Recreating weekdays column in data df
data$DATE = as.Date(data$DATE)
data$weekdays <- weekdays(data$DATE)

library(lubridate)
# Recreating month column in data df
data$month <- month(data$DATE)
# Creating a year column in the data df
data$year<- year(data$DATE)
```

```{r}
# Assignment 3 question 14: Find the median cases in RI during 2021 by weekday
data %>%
  filter(year==2021, STATE=='Rhode Island') %>%
  group_by(weekdays) %>%
  summarise(median_cases = median(CASES))
```
```{r}
# Assignment 3 question 15: Compare the median cases in Rhode Island in June, July, August # and September in 2021.
data %>%
  filter(year==2021, month==6 | month==7 | month==8 | month==9, STATE=='Rhode Island') %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(median_cases = median(CASES))
```

-------

#### 9. Combo 3: filter + group_by + summarise + arrange

Use the arrange function to find a month that has the highest number of deaths on the weekend. 
```{r}
covid_df %>% 
  filter(weekday == 6 | weekday == 7) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(total_death = sum(death, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-total_death)
```

-------

#### 10. Use your own dataset and implement the follows functions or combos. You can use the [Adult Census Income](../data/adult_census.csv) or [Titanic data](../data/titanic.csv). 

- select
- filter
- mutate
- summarise
- arrange
- count
- count + arrange
- filter + count + arrange
- group_by + summarise
- filter + group_by + summarise
- filter + group_by + summarise + arrange
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Importing Census data
census_df <- read_csv("adult_census.csv")
```
```{r}
# Using selecting census_df without 'workclass' column
census_df %>% select(-workclass)
```
```{r}
# Filtering observations to only those who's education level was 'HS-grad'
census_df %>% 
  filter(education == 'HS-grad')
```
```{r}
# Creating net_capital column as difference between capital.gain and capital.loss
census_df %>% mutate(net_capital = capital.gain - capital.loss)
```
```{r}
# Getting mean age of people in census_df
census_df %>% summarise(mean(age))
```
```{r}
# Arranging observations in census_df by age ascending
census_df %>% arrange(age)
```
```{r}
# Getting counts of observations in census_df by racial group
census_df %>% count(race)
```
```{r}
# Getting counts of observations in census_df by native country and arranging these by...
# ... country in alphabetical order
census_df %>% count(native.country) %>% arrange(native.country)
```
```{r}
# Getting counts of unmarried people by their occupation and arranging these by ...
# ...occupation in alphabetical order
census_df %>% 
  filter(relationship == 'Unmarried') %>%
  count(occupation) %>%
  arrange(occupation)

```
```{r}
# Getting mean age of observation groups based on marital.status
census_df %>% 
  group_by(marital.status) %>% 
  summarise(mean(age))
```
```{r}
# Calculating mean hours per work worked by sales workers based on their education level
census_df %>% 
  filter(occupation=='Sales') %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(mean(hours.per.week))
```
```{r}
# Calculating mean capital.gain by gender in unmarried people
census_df %>% 
  filter(relationship == 'Unmarried') %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(capital_gain = mean(capital.gain, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(-capital_gain)
```
